Coding Exercise 1
I want something to analyse the pattern between film language and its rental rate. Send me a data extract (a report) that shows language of each movie, its title and the rental rate.

SELECT f.title, f.rental_rate, l.name 
FROM film f
JOIN language l
ON f.language_id =l.language_id
ORDER BY rental_rate DESC;

Coding Exercise 2
Show me a list of actors and the count of movies they have acted in. Sort it in a way that the actor who has done most movies is at top.

SELECT actor.actor_id, CONCAT (actor.first_name,' ',actor.last_name) AS "Actor Name",
count(film.film_id) AS "Movies Acted In"
FROM actor
JOIN film_actor
ON actor.actor_id = film_actor.actor_id
JOIN film
ON film.film_id=film_actor.film_id
GROUP BY actor.actor_id
ORDER BY "Movies Acted In" DESC;

Coding Exercise 3
I want to create a report, that shows the different ratings of all movies, and count of movies that have been rented for each rating

SELECT film.rating, COUNT inventory.inventory_id) 
FROM rental
JOIN inventory
ON rental.inventory_id=inventory.inventory_id 
RIGHT JOIN FILM
ON inventory. film_id =film.film_id
GROUP BY film.rating
ORDER BY COUNT (inventory.inventory_id) DESC;

Folder 10

Coding Exercise 1
The "rental" table has fields for rental_date (when the movie was rented), and return_date (when it was returned). We want to reach out to customers whose rental duration was 7 or more days, and send them an email. Can you create a report for me that lists down following columns:
Rental Date
Return Date
Rent Duration - that is, difference between two dates (HINT: Use AGE function)
Customer First name
Customer Last Name
Customer Email
You can find the last 3 fields in the "customer" table

Keep the data sorted by rent duration (high to low) so we can see the longest renters first.

select rental.rental_date, rental.return_date, AGE(return_date, rental_date) as "Rental Duration",
customer.first_name, customer.last_name, customer.email
from rental join customer
on rental.customer_id = customer.customer_id
where AGE(return_date, rental_date)>=interval '7 days'

Coding Exercise 2
The "film" table has a title field containing name of movies. Some of the movie names are pretty long. Practice writing queries using SUBSTR function to do following:
Return string after the 10th character
Return string after the 15th character. Notice how some results are blank because titles do not have 15 characters (HINT: You can use the LENGTH() function to see length of title)
Return string after the 5th character, just 3 words
Return string after the 5th character, just 1 word

select title, substr(title,10) from film
select title, substr(title,15) from film
select title,length(title), substr(title,15) from film
select title,length(title), substr(title,5,3) from film
select title,length(title), substr(title,5,1) from film
