Coding Exercise 1
The "payment" table stores customer ids and amount they have paid. I want to get the list of customer ids that have rented out movies that cost 7.99 or more so I can put them in a "Platinum" category and send them coupons later.
Can you give me a report containing that?

SELECT DISTINCT customer_id
FROM payment
WHERE amount>=7.99;

Coding Exercise 2
The "film" table contains details of films we rent, including their name, rental cost and replacement cost. Take a look at the table and generate a query that tells me high value films, meaning those that:
a: have rental rate more than 2.99, OR
b: replacement cost more than 19.99
I want the report to be very simple, so just include the movie name, rental cost and replacement cost in there.

SELECT title AS "Movie", rental_rate AS "Rent", replacement_cost AS "Replacement"
FROM film
WHERE rental_rate>2.99 OR replacement_cost>19.99;
